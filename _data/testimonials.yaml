The consistency of several things impress me:  The quality of their workmanship; Their willingness to go above and beyond as an advocate for their client in dealing with the insurance companies; The efficiency of their crew; Their sensitivity to time constraints of an operating restaurant so as not to inconvenience staff or guests; Site clean up and attention to detail.  I have had the pleasure of knowing the owner Pete McLane of over six years both personally and professionally and I think very highly of his personal integrity and work ethic.  I would definitely hire his company again."

They  re-sided my house after hail damage and were efficient, professional and worked  with the insurance company, which was no easy task.  Everything came  in as budgeted.  I have recommended him to my friends and they too are  very happy with his work. I'd use him again without hesitation."

You did a great job of working within the agreed upon budget while at the same time providing exceptional quality.  When faced with a budget limitation on an enhancement  that we requested, you demonstrated flexibility and creativity in enabling the project to proceed.  I appreciate the work that you did directly with my insurance company both in advance of getting stared and during the renovation.  Your team ensured that the waste from the construction was cleaned up each evening before leaving, which was particularly important to me given that we have young children.  Thank you for making such a dramatic enhancement to our home."
