intro_text: "I started  M<sup>c</sup>Lane Construction in 2007, as just me and a couple
  of tools.  Since then the company has grown and developed, finding a niche in our
  community and an identity that would sustain us: we do safe, quality work.  A big
  part of that is our crew.  I believe that M<sup>c</sup>Lane Construction should
  be a place where our employees are part of a community, build new skills, and are
  proud of themselves and their work.  We work as a team, we work hard, but we also
  know that work is not everything, so we play too.   \n<br><br>- Pete"
