Metal panels come in all shapes and sizes: corrugated, single or double lock standing seam, mechanical or snap lock standing seam, screw-down panels, different gauges, and all sorts of colors.  We work with several local suppliers that manufacture panels and custom trim.

**Pros:** A metal roof can last forever.  If installed correctly, a double seamed mechanically locked metal roof is as good as it gets, and can be effective down to a Â¼:12 pitch.  They are less penetrable to leaks caused by pooling water, such as from ice dams, and are tough.

**Cons:** A metal roof can be very expensive.  As the gauge of metal goes up, so does price.  Add in extra for mechanically locked double seams.  Then there are the snowbreaks, a vital component over any trafficked area.  The tally can get daunting, and depending on your roof construction, some of these line items are not optional.

**The Craft:**  Each step, from planning to install, makes our metal roofs a work of art that stand the test of time:

* A careful layout plan for panels and trim.  Each piece is ordered to fit, and has a home.
* The right tools for the job, from hand seamers and welting irons, to a power seamer and a snap table.
* No pinch points
* Crisp, clean details.  Our guys do origami with metal.  High and tight, every time.
* Trim/flashing
