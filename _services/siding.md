Siding protects your building from the elements, critters, and bumps and scrapes.  It is also a major architectural feature and has has as much verity as you can dream up.  Wood, composite, metal, masonry.  Vertical, horizontal, and everything inbetween.  Lapped, or rainscreen.  Each of these have different profiles, finishes, and colors to choose from.  We do it all, except for masonry.

**Pros and Cons:** Oh, the choices!  Our little pop-up window could never do the topic justic.  Instead, we encourage you to talk with your Architect, go for a walk around your neighborhood, and give us a call.  

The Craft:

1. Making a plan
2. Details
3. Take a step back
4. Critter proof
