Siding protects your building from the elements, critters, and bumps and scrapes.  It is also a major architectural feature and has has as much variety as you can dream up.  Wood, composite, metal, masonry.  Vertical, horizontal, and everything in between.  Lapped, or rainscreen.  Each of these have different profiles, finishes, and colors to choose from.  The only thing we don't do is masonry.

**Pros and Cons:** Oh, the choices!  Our little pop-up window could never do the topic justic.  Instead, we encourage you to talk with your Architect, go for a walk around your neighborhood, and give us a call.

**The Craft:**

1. We always start with a layout plan.  Our job is to convince your eye that everything is parallel and straight in all the right places.  And we are prepaired for windows, doors, drier vents, and utility meters long before we get to them.
2. Details.  When it comes to cutting, folding, griding, and riveting metal, our guys are artists.
3. We take a step back and walk up to your building as you would, a passer by, or one of your customers.  We wonder about the view out your office winow and what might catch your eye.
