Metal panels come in all shapes and sizes: corrugated, single or double lock standing seam, mechanical or snap lock standing seam, screw-down panels, different gauges, and all sorts of colors.  We work with several local suppliers that manufacture panels and custom trim.

**Pros:** A metal roof can last forever.  If installed correctly, a double seamed mechanically locked metal roof is as good as it gets, and can be effective down to a Â¼:12 pitch.  They are less penetrable to leaks caused by pooling water, such as from ice dams, and are tough.

**Cons:** A metal roof can be very expensive.  As the gauge of metal goes up, so does price.  Add in extra for mechanically locked double seams.  Then there are the snowbreaks, a vital component over any trafficked area.  The tally can get daunting, and depending on your roof construction, some of these line items are not optional.

**The Craft:**  Each step, from planning to install, makes our metal roofs a work of art that stand the test of time:

1. A careful layout plan for panels and trim.  Each piece is ordered to fit, and has a home.
2. The right tools for the job, from hand seamers and welting irons, to a power seamer and a snap table.
3. No pinch points for water to stall out and pool up.
4. Crisp, clean details.  Our guys do origami with metal.  High and tight, every time.
5. Perfect flashing will always save the day
