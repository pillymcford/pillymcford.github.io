Roofing and siding tie into the whole building system, so when we show up for a fix, our goal is to diagnose and address the underlying cause.  Our crew is trained to pay close attention to and have a working knowledge of venting, framing, vapor barriers, and insulation.  Here are some common symptoms and why they happen:

**Leaks:** Water coming into your building from the outside.

* Clogged or undersized scuppers or overflow drains
* Pipe jacks (dry rotted, or on backwards)
* Ice dams

**Condensation and mold:** Water vapor that is unable to escape the building efficiently.

**Ice dams:**

**Degraded shingles:**

**Blown off shingles:**

**Rotten or bubbling siding:**
