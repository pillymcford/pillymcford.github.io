Roofing and siding tie into the whole building system, so when we show up for a fix, our goal is to diagnose and address the underlying cause.  Our crew is trained to pay close attention to and have a working knowledge of venting, framing, vapor barriers, and insulation.  Here are some common symptoms and why they happen:

**Leaks:** Water getting into your building from the outside.

* Incorrect or missing flashing
* Incorrect or missing dry-in
* Clogged or undersized scuppers or overflow drains
* Pipe jacks are dry rotted or have been installed incorrectly
* Ice dams

**Condensation and mold:** Water vapor that is unable to escape the building efficiently.

* Poor insulation.  When warm air from inside your building hits a cold surface, it condenses
* Poor ventilation.  Vents are not sized correctly, or something is blocking the flow of air, such as framing or insulation

**Ice dams:** Water that freezes on the eves of your roof, blocking the flow of water off of your roof, and causing it to pool. 

* Poor insulation.  When the heat from inside your building causes the snow on the roof to melt, but as soon as the water gets past the exterior wall, it freezes again.
* Incorrectly installed heat tape.  Heat tape does not necessarly prevent ice dams from froming, but creates channels through the snow and ice for water to escape.  

**Degraded shingles:** This could look like sluffing granules, curling shingles, or buckling shingles.

**Blown off shingles:**

**Rotten or bubbling siding:**
