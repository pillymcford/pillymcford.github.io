We work with Malarkey and Certainteed shingles most often.  In Montana, the style is almost always “Architectural”, but there are many colors to choose from.

**Pros**: Asphalt shingles are the most common roofing material, and you guessed it, the least expensive.  You can expect the life of an asphalt roof to last up to 50 years, depending on ventilation and workmanship.

**Cons:** Asphalt shingles have their limitations.  A shingled roof is designed to work when water flows over and off of it.  In situations where water gets backed-up, leaks will likely develop.  This can happen when ice dams form and where there are pinch points in the framing.  Also for this reason, asphalt shingles should not be installed on roof pitches less than 2:12.

**The Craft:** There are many components of our asphalt roof installation that contribute to its high performance, long life, and dashing good looks:

1. Underlayment can be more important than the shingles themselves, especially in vulnerable spots.
2. A layout plan makes sure our rows look parallel, straight, and the same size all the way up, despite any wonky framing.  No skinny rows allowed.
3. Perfect flashing is the strongest line of defense against leaks on an asphalt roof.

We handle our shingles with care.  Asphalt shingles become brittle in the winter, and turn mushy in the summer.  A delicate touch and a section sequence plan ensures your shingles are not compromised.

Adequate ventilation is a must.  Without it, asphalt shingles overheat and degrade quickly, and condensation gets trapped in attic spaces and causes rot and mold.
