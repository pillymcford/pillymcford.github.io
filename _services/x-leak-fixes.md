Roofing and siding tie into the whole building system, so when we show up for a fix, our goal is to diagnose and address the underlying cause.  Our crew is trained to pay close attention to and have a working knowledge of venting, framing, vapor barriers, and insulation.  Here are some common symptoms and why they happen:

**Leaks:** Water getting into your building from the outside.

* Incorrect or missing flashing
* Incorrect or missing dry-in
* Clogged or undersized scuppers or overflow drains
* Pipe jacks are worn out or have been installed incorrectly
* Ice dams

**Condensation and mold:** Water vapor that is unable to escape the building efficiently.  Commonly mistaken for a leak.

* Poor insulation.  Warm air from inside your building hits a cold surface and condenses
* Poor ventilation.  Vents are not sized correctly, or something is blocking the flow of air, such as framing or insulation

**Ice dams:** Water that freezes on the eves of your roof, blocking the flow of water off of your roof, and causing it to pool.

* Poor insulation.  Heat from inside your building causes the snow on the roof to melt, but as soon as the water gets past the exterior wall, it freezes again.
* Incorrectly installed heat tape.  Heat tape does not necessarly prevent ice dams from froming, but is designed to create channels through the snow and ice for water to escape.

**Degraded shingles:** This could look like sluffing granules, and curling or buckling shingles.

* Poor ventilation.  Without adequate ventilation, shingles can overheat, especially cedar products, and degrade quickly.
* Shingles intalled too tight together have no room to expand when they warm-up.

**Blown off shingles:** Oh no, that's embarassing!

* Sloppy nailing pattern.  Each different type of shingle has its own nailing pattern, detailing where and how many nails to use.
* Nail blowouts.  Compressors and nail guns must be adjusted correctly.  Asphalt shingles become brittle and must be handled with care in the winter.

**Chipping or bubbling paint:** This could mean the siding is taking on water, causing it to expand and contract, and wear out the paint.

* Siding installed too close to the roof deck or the ground
* Incorrect or missing roof flashing
* Incorrect or missing flashing around windows and doors
* Clogged gutters
