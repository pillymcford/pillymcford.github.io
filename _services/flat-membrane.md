Flat roofing can be done with several types of materials, but we prefer to work TPO, or thermoplastic polyolefin (actually a rubber), sourced from R&S Supply in Bozeman.  Unlike other flat roofing materials, TPO can be heat welded together.  This means that seams and details, which are the most vulnerable places on your roof, are not reliant on glue.  Heat welding results in a stronger and more complete bond, and allows us to keep working all winter long becuase the bond is not temperature dependent.

**Pros:** Flat roofing membrain can be installed on roofs with a pitch as low as 1/8" per foot.  We are essentially prepairing for your roof to be a swimming pool.  Done well, a rubber membrain is the strongest line of defense against standing water.

**Cons:** In Montana, snow can really pile up on a flat roof, so your roof framing has to be beefy enough to handel it.  If there is so much as a pin prick in the membrain, the roof will leak.  And leaks are hard to track down, because once water gets through, it can travel long distances before dripping down where you notice it.

**The Craft:**

1. We use TPO coated metal for our flashing details, which means we can weld the roof membrain directly to the flashing and create a continuous waterproof surface.
2. Flat is a misnomer.  A slight pitch is critical, and we are meticulouse about maintaining atleast 1/8" per foot of slope to direct water off of your roof.
3. Drains must be placed and sized correctly to prevent water from backing up and giving it a chance to find a pin prick hole, or exceeding your roof's designed weight loads.  Experience and close attention to detail ensures water will not wick around your scuppers and drip behind your siding.
