Craftsmanship describes both a skill and a quality of product: it is a skill that has been honed by experience, and it is the quality achieved by designing and building with care and attention to detail.  At McLane Construction, we are not just roofers and siders, we are craftsmen, and we take pride in creating something of quality in both form and function.

**Honed**: McLane Construction has worked on over 1200 jobs in and around Bozeman. Across all disciplines, we use manufacturer's specifications and local building codes as minimum standards, and then go above and beyond. Montana is tough on buildings, and we have learned tips and tricks over the years to ensure our work can withstand a harsh and varied climate. We have also fixed hundreds of roofs and siding, and we know what to look out for and what not to do.

**Designed**: Every roofing and siding project starts with a plan to anticipate and solve challenges to both form and function. We are prepared for windows, doors, drier vents, and utility meters long before we get to them. Does your chimney have a cricket? Do we need to design custom metal pieces for a particularly vulnerable valley? From accommodating out of square framing to a beautiful screw pattern, our job is to convince your eye that everything is parallel and straight in all the right places.

**Detailed**: High and tight, every time! One missing piece of flashing can rot your roof and cause extensive structural damage. One pinhole in a flat roof can compromise the whole job. And then when it comes to cutting, folding, griding, and riveting metal, our guys are artists. At McLane Construction, we like crisp, clean details, and we donâ€™t like call backs.
