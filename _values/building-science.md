Building science is the behavior of a building as a system, and impacts a structure’s energy efficiency and durability. Much of this comes down to the building envelope, which begins at the interface between conditioned and unconditioned space. The building envelope is made up of framing, windows, insulation, roofing, and siding. The integrity of your building depends on all of these disciplines working together. When the building envelope is working well, we avoid common problems like condensation, ice dams, and shingle degradation.

**Condensation:** About 50% of the calls we get about a leaky roof are actually condensation. When warm, moist air from a conditioned space is cooled, it condenses. In cold climates, moving moisture out of your building is just as important as preventing it from getting in. Water vapor produced by people, pets, washing dishes, drying cloths, and showering needs an efficient way to escape. Otherwise, it gets trapped, causing rot and mold, and often looks just like a leak. When we install your roof and siding, we are in a position to check that the ventilation system is functioning throughout the building envelope. Not only does this protect your home, but also our weekends, since we are the ones that get the call when water starts dripping from the ceiling!

**Ice Dams:** Ice dams form when snow on the roof melts, flows down past the exterior wall, and freezes on the eves. They are an indication that the building envelope is not performing efficiently. Inadequate insulation and ventilation cause the heat from inside your home to warm the roof, but the eaves extend past the condition space below, and they remain cold. Per standard building codes, we always use ice and water shield to dry in at least 2 feet inside all exterior walls, so there is extra beefy water proofing incase ice dams do form. But we are always watching for potential problems in the building envelope so that we prevent them from occurring in the first place.

**Degraded Shingles:** Without adequate insulation and ventilation, the roof deck and shingles can overheat and degrade quickly, especially cedar products. This could look like sluffing granules, and curling or buckling shingles. A mistake made by the framers or insulators, or an oversight by the architect can cause our work to fail prematurely, and we don’t like that, so while we are up there, we are sure to check that the building envelope is functioning correctly.
